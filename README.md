# Word-Guess-Game

Thank you for visiting my word guessing game. This was made early when learning the basics of Javascript. The idea was to create a simple hangman game. This is based on popular bands from the 90's. You have 7 guesses per round, the script in place does prevent the same letters from being guessed, and only letters can be guessed as well. (So bands like Blink 182 will not be a possibility). The goal of this game was to learn how to apply Javascript on our webpages and an example of what can be done with it.
